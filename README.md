# Franz
An FM inspired custom oscillator for the **Korg Nu:Tekt NTS-1**.  

## Usage
The oscillator is build around four sine components plus noise, where randomization is applied to the sub component's duration and pitch. Ideally set the **envelope generator** to either **Open** or **Ar** as the note duration is controlled by the **B** encoder - then just use the arpeggiator to enable instant playback!

**A + B** encoders are used to control the **timbre** and **duration**.
Accessing the **oscillator parameters**, you control the gain for each component (1 max - 10 min).
